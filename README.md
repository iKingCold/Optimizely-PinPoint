## Summary
The solution consists of 3 different project types.<br/>
`MapCore` contains shared logic between providers and Core Map files required to render the Leaflet map<br/>
`MapProvider.*provider*` contains a ProviderService that implements provider-specific settings.<br/>
`MapDemo` contains a demo website for testing the Map Widget.<br/>

The project has been tested with **Optimizely Alloy**, **Optimizely Decoupled MusicFestival** & **Optimizely Empty Project**.
MusicFestival is a sample project that uses the Content Delivery API in a headless CMS structure. https://github.com/episerver/musicfestival-vue-template
